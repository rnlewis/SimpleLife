This is a simple project to showcase my coding skills and creativity using the Processing software.

The simulation initially generates 1,000 total of 8 different types of "Life", each type has a positive or negative relationship with all 8 types.
This relationship determines how each life interacts with the surrounding organisms.  Sliders for interaction strength, speed, and the interaction 
distance are customizable to create unique patterns and processes.

I used Microsoft Copilot for commenting and basic syntax help.
